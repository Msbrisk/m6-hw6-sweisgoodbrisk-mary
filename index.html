        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a native Floridian and currently reside in St. Augustine, Florida 
            with my husband and two mini-dachsunds. Our kids are 24 and 19, so we are
            officially empty nesters. I have worked in the wine and spirits industry for
            almost 25 years and am currently a wine consultant for the second largest
            distributor in North America. I am also a student at the University of Florida
            pursuing a Masters degree in Political Communication. I am looking forward to
            graduating this summer and pursuing a new career in political communication.
